Macroscopic dark matter (macros) is a broad class of alternative candidates to
particle dark matter. These candidates would transfer energy to matter
primarily through elastic scattering. A sufficiently large macro passing
through the atmosphere would produce a straight channel of ionized plasma. If
the cross-section of the macro is :math:`\sigma_x \gtrapprox 6 \times 10^{-9}
cm^2`, then under atmospheric conditions conducive to lightning (eg. a
thunderstorm) the plasma channel would be sufficient to seed a lightning
strike with a single leader. This is entirely unlike ordinary bolt lightning
in which a long sequence of hundreds or thousands of few-meter-long leaders
are strung together. This macro-induced lightning would be extremely straight,
and thus highly distinctive. Neither wind shear nor magnetohydrodynamic
instabilities would markedly spoil its straightness. The only photographically
documented case of a straight lightning bolt is probably not straight enough
to have been macro-induced.

We estimate the region of macro parameter space that could be probed by a
search for straight lightning from the number of thunderstorms happening on
Earth at any time. We also estimate the parameter space that can be probed by
carefully monitoring Jupiter, e.g. using a Jupiter probe.
